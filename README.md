# Pokitto game projects
Games are run on the [Pokitto](https://pokitto.com) console. For those not fortunate enough to have a Pokitto console, the [PokittoEmu](https://github.com/felipemanga/PokittoEmu) emulator works just fine. Development library available [here](https://github.com/pixelbath/PokittoLib).
