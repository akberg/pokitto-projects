# Space Escape
Entry in Arm Norway's Game Jam on itch.io.

*At the en of your mission on the space station, you manage to pres sthe self-destruct button (who equips the controls of a space station with a self-destruct button?!), now you only have two minutes to find the escape pod and get away! The station is a labyrint of modules, though, and the artificial gravity is not always consistent.*
